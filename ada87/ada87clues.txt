# this problem proved to be very difficult for the computer to solve.
# after solving it with this hybrid auto/manual mechanism, I determined that the
# two places that the algorithm was insufficient were:
# a) determining whether all the final shapes of a partially complete region would overlap existing complete regions
#    (this logic step was very common for the 1x1, 1x2, and 2x2 ell shapes)
# b) visualizing that all possible paths between known cells of a pattern would cause another pattern's cells to be cut off
