The approach in old works for the example, but on the larger puzzle, the vastly increased number of possible paths prove infeasible to
calculate ahead of time.

The new solution is to create a living tree of the paths, and expand it out as we go; hopefully this will limit the number of
simultaneous live paths to something feasible.
