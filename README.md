# AlbertsAdalogicalAenigmas
Albert very much enjoys using AI to solve puzzles, and is a fan of Pavel's Adalogical Aenigmas, one-page logic puzzles published monthly at http://www.pavelspuzzles.com/aenigmas/ There are also a few other puzzles that fall under this rubric due to structural similarities, and a growing library of solving tools for grid-based puzzles
